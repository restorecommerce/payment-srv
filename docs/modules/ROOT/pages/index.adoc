== Configuration

[#configuration_purchase_flow]
=== Purchase flow

The purchase flow is the simpler option.

It goes through the following steps:

. Setup the purchase flow (`SetupPurchase` method)
. User redirection to the payment platform page
. After user returns from payment platform, complete the payment (`Purchase` method)

It does not require a checkout or approval page on the store page.

=== Authorization Flow

The authorization flow utilizes the option that after returning from the payment
platform the user can do a final review of the invoice before it gets approved.

It goes through the following steps:

. Setup the authorization flow (`SetupAuthorization` method)
. User redirection to the payment platform page
. After user returns from payment platform, approve the authorization (`Authorize` method)
. Show the full invoice with an approval button to the user.
. After user has approved, complete the payment (`Capture` method)
